## Using MongoDB, Express, React and Node
- ### Mongo dbüçÉ
	An open-source NoSQL document-oriented database management system that uses a flexible JSON-like document data model. MongoDB supports dynamic schema, which means that each document in a collection can have a different structure, and new fields can be added to a document without requiring a schema modification.
- ### Express‚ö°
	It provides a range of features, including routing, middleware, and templating engines. With Express.js, developers can easily create HTTP endpoints, define middleware functions to handle requests, and use various templating engines to render views.
- ### React‚öõÔ∏è
	It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. React allows developers to create complex user interfaces by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and can be easily combined with other components to create a complete application.
- ### Nodeüîó
	Node.js allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, which makes it easier to switch between the client-side and server-side development. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, and allows it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections. It also provides access to a rich library of modules, which can be used to simplify common programming tasks such as networking, file I/O, and database access.
